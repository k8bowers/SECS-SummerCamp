# Adventures in Coding 2

This folder introduces Python concepts such as classes, inheritance, and goes into further detail on using pygame to program a working game (breakout clone).

The main game files are `breakout.py` and `breakout-levels.py`, whereas all other `*.py` files in this directory are intermediate steps for the students to use to follow along with the presentation.
